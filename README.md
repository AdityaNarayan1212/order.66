# 🛡️ Order 66 - Sith Productivity App

> "Execute Order 66... and focus like a true apprentice of the Dark Side."

A Star Wars-themed, full-stack productivity timer app that transforms your focus sessions into an immersive Sith experience. Built with React, Node.js, and Socket.IO for real-time collaboration.

## 🎯 What is Order 66?

Order 66 is a gamified productivity application that combines the Pomodoro Technique with Star Wars Sith theming to create an engaging focus environment. Users complete 25-minute focus sessions (Pomodoros) to gain experience points, unlock Sith ranks, and build streaks while managing tasks and tracking progress.
